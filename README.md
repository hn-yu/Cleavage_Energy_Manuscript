# Surface Energy Manuscript

This repository contains various scripts/notebooks we used to create the results in our paper.

## Clone the repository including submodules:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:hn-yu/Cleavage_Energy_Manuscript.git
```

  - [Cleavage energy dataset](#surface-energy-dataset)
  - [Train a CGCNN model](#train-a-cgcnn-model)


## Prerequisites
* Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks ([CGCNN](https://github.com/ulissigroup/cgcnn/tree/sklearn_refactor))

* Additional packages required for cgcnn environmnet:
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org)
- AdamW

## Usage

### Cleavage energy dataset

Located in the `cleavage_energy_dataset` folder. 

We have included a pickel file that contain our cleavage energy data.

### Train a CGCNN model

Located in the `train_CGCNN_model` folder.

We have included the cgcnn we used, and `random_assignment` method. `random_assignment_method.ipynb` notebook splits the data randomly into 8:2 training: test set, and uses CGCNN to train a model. **You need to clone the CGCNN repository and install all the prerequisite packages in order to run these notebooks** 

We have included the optimized paramters we used for CGCNN:
